# TL;DR

1. The Aptos blockchain is fast, cheap, and stable. We want to make it clear that we're building for scalable applications
2. Aptos smart contracts catch more exploits at compile, runtime, and through verification for critical logic.
3. Building with Aptos comes with all the tools to spin up a dapp prototype in less than 10 minutes without needing to spin up your own infrastructure or re-invent dapp UIs.
4. Aptos is improving over time. It's built to update on-chain logic, there are constantly new community tools to improve dapp building, and the contract language is becoming more robust.
5. The tokens and assets on-chain are easy to trade and manage through exchanges, bridges, and robust integrations with many finance apps.

# On-Chain Performance

## Less Than 1 Second to Finality

### Learning objective: Understand why Aptos feels instant to end-users

- Consensus, execution, storage overlap; no global "stop-the-world" step.
- Mainnet finality about one second; worst-case less than 3 seconds in public tests.
- Predictable fees because blocks never pile up in a mempool queue.

## Aptos Scales (So Fees Don't Rise)

### Learning objective: Explain how Aptos grows with hardware *and* design headroom

- **Block-STM** auto-detects non-conflicts → peaks of *fourteen thousand three hundred and forty TPS* and *fifty-one point six million transactions in one day* without fee spikes (&lt;$0.002/tx).
- More cores = more threads today; roadmap adds homogeneous state sharding tomorrow.
- No external L2s needed → simpler UX and fewer bridge trust assumptions.

## Stable Under Stress

### Learning objective: Articulate why throughput remains stable during traffic spikes

- Parallelism defuses fee auctions even during viral events (e.g., *Tapos 2* surge).
- If validators crash, multi-proposer BFT rotates leaders automatically—no halt, no reorg.
- Historical highs (May 25, 2024: 115 million transactions) show throughput holds up in the wild.

# Security Model

## Compile-Time Safety (before you lose your money)

### Learning objective: Show how resource-oriented programming (Move Language Safety) prevents whole classes of exploits

- Resource-oriented assets can't be cloned or dropped; no re-entrancy or overflow.
- Strong static typing and bytecode verifier gate bad code.
- Same model now adopted by multiple chains—Move's safety is industry-validated.

## Runtime Guardrails

### Learning objective: Highlight Aptos's "paranoid mode" and Defense-in-Depth runtime guards

- "Paranoid mode" re-checks type/resource safety on every call.
- Optional strict mode for high-value contracts (extra runtime audits).
- Joint audits + one million dollar bounty program caught critical bugs pre-mainnet.

## Provably Safe Contracts via Formal Verification

### Learning objective: Position Move Prover as everyday developer linting, not ivory-tower math

- Developers specify invariants ("total_supply never changes"); **Move Prover** enforces automatically by turning them into machine proofs.
- Core framework modules fully proven + audited by 3+ external firms pre-mainnet
- Prover runs inside CI like a lint step—no PhD required.

# Developer Experience

## First-Class Tooling Stack

### Learning objective: Outline what devs get day 1

- Aptos CLI for localnet, devnet, testnet, faucet, key-mgmt, compiling, publishing, and interacting with contracts
- VS Code & JetBrains plugins with Move syntax + inline Prover feedback
- Typescript/Rust/Python SDKs auto-generated from on-chain ABI

## Rapid Iteration & In-Place Upgrades

### Learning objective: Show how you "fix the plane while flying"

- Module address stays constant across versions; downstream calls keep working
- No proxy patterns; upgrade approved via on-chain governance or maintainer key
- "Fix-the-plane-while-flying" flow matches Web2 continuous delivery

## AI-Ready Documentation & Chatbot

### Learning objective: Emphasize AI assist during build/learn cycles

- Docs structured for chunkable LLM consumption—clear headers, low ambiguity; LLMs-txt.
- Aptos Chatbot (in development) surfaces code snippets, CLI commands, API keys, on demand. Aptos Learn Vibe Coder prompts can walk a complete beginner through writing, compiling, and publishing their first smart contract on Aptos.
- Cutting edge MCP abilities to speed up your development workflow

## Onboarding meets you where you are

### Learning objective: Reduce switching cost for Solidity/Solana devs

- Ethereum-to-Aptos / Solana-to-Aptos cheatsheets and Aptos Learn Workshops map concepts 1-to-1
- Starter templates (Create Aptos Dapp) for wallets, NFTs, DeFi primitives in Move + React
- AI chatbot reminder, and Aptos Vibes showcase

# Upgradeability & Modular Design

## On-Chain Governance for Core Logic

### Learning objective: Explain how protocol evolves without forks

- Accounts, the APT coin, staking, and other system modules live as Move packages at `0x1`; updates are published through on-chain [governance proposals](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/mainnet-proposals), so validators vote the new code in—no hard fork or node reinstall needed.
- The `0x1::gas_schedule` table and feature-flag resource are also on chain; a single gas/feature proposal can lower fees or enable new VM op-codes, and changes propagate within the next epoch (≈ 4 h).
- Governance has already executed **100 +** framework or gas-table proposals—see the live list on [GovScan](https://govscan.live/aptos/proposals)—all applied without halting block production, demonstrating true zero-downtime upgrades.

## Hot-Swappable VM & Consensus Layers

### Learning objective: Reassure that today's dApps survive tomorrow's improvements

- VM versioning guarantees backward compatibility; old bytecode still executes
- Research-driven consensus upgrades (e.g., faster QC) can roll out with zero downtime like software patches
- Testing gates (devnet → testnet → mainnet) catch regressions early.

## Future-Proof Scaling Modules

### Learning objective: Describe path to internal sharding & zk-features

- Experimental homogeneous state shards are already coded behind a *feature gate*; once performance testing is complete, validators can vote to flip the switch and spread state across multiple shards without extra operator complexity—see the "internal sharding of a validator and **homogeneous state sharding**" note in the [Aptos White Paper](https://aptos.dev/en/network/blockchain/aptos-white-paper).
- *Aptos Confidential Transactions* (ACTs) are live on Devnet today, giving builders a plug-and-play way to hide balances and transfer amounts with zero-knowledge proofs; details and API snippets are in the launch post "[Confidential Transactions now live on Aptos Devnet.](https://forum.aptosfoundation.org/t/confidential-transactions-now-live-on-aptos-devnet/16355)" (June 2025)
- The roadmap explicitly reserves VM op-code slots for alternative signature schemes (e.g., BLS, PQC) and the core team is already researching post-quantum options, as called out by co-founder Avery Ching in May 2025—see "[Aptos prepares for post-quantum security.](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/aptos-prepares-for-post-quantum-security-crypto-resilience-and-future-proofing-highlighted-by-alinush407)"

# Ecosystem Readiness

- **Native USDC** (Oct 2024) and **native USDT** (Oct 2024) are already minted on Aptos, and both trade on major CEX spot pairs—see Circle's announcement "[Native USDC on Aptos](https://www.circle.com/blog/now-available-native-usdc-on-aptos)" and the Aptos Foundation note "[USDT on the Move](https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/usdt-on-the-move-tether-aptos-integration)."
- The Wormhole codebase that services Aptos has been audited by both [Halborn](https://aptosfoundation.org/ecosystem/project/halborn) and [Kudelski Security](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-audits/blob/main/2022-08-16_kudelski.pdf); since Aptos mainnet launched in 2022 there have been **no Aptos-specific bridge exploits reported**.

## Live dApps & Network Metrics

### Learning objective: Validate real adoption, not test-lab claims

- Top DEX processes ~30 k swaps/day at &lt;$0.002 fee each.
